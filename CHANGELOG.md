## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- **Challenge detection no longer false-positives on CDN-fronted `200` pages.**
  A response is now classified as a bot-wall challenge only when it carries the
  definitive `cf-mitigated` header, or arrives with a **blocking status**
  (`403`/`429`/`503`) *and* a specific interstitial token (a challenge-script
  `src`, a captcha-delivery host, a verification class). Previously, benign
  Cloudflare signals on an ordinary `200` — the `/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/`
  JS-detections beacon, `server: cloudflare`, `__cf_bm` cookies — or even a page
  whose *copy* merely mentioned a vendor name were mislabeled `needs_browser`,
  making Draco give up on sites `curl` reads fine. This defeated the tool's core
  purpose; extraction now proceeds on any `2xx`. (Reported against a
  Cloudflare-DNS site with no anti-bot enforcement.)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-05

First release. A browserless, tiered data-extraction engine — a statically
buildable Rust workspace (7 crates) with a `draco` CLI.

### The tiered engine
- **Tier 0 — static extraction** (`draco-static`): `__NEXT_DATA__`, JSON-LD, and
  object-literal `window.__NUXT__`, via a quote-aware HTML scan.
- **Tier 1 — heuristic API replay** (`draco-static` + `draco-core`): discover a
  Next.js `buildId` and fetch `/_next/data/<buildId>/…​.json` directly; app-router
  (RSC) pages are detected and escalate.
- **Tier 2 — runtime interception** (`draco-runtime` + `draco-jail`): a jitless
  V8 isolate hydrates the page, its `fetch`/`XHR` calls are intercepted, ranked,
  and the winner is replayed with the stealth client. Proven end-to-end against a
  **real Vue 3.5.39 bundle** that hydrates in-isolate and leaks a response-driven
  dependent fetch.

### Networking (`draco-net`)
- `wreq 6.0.0-rc.29` (BoringSSL) Chrome JA4/TLS + HTTP/2 emulation with preserved
  header order; per-session cookie jar; http/https/socks5 proxy; per-host delay
  with jitter; 429/503 backoff honoring `Retry-After`; robots.txt (respected by
  default); redirect cap; connect + total timeouts.

### Orchestration (`draco-core`)
- Escalation state machine with a challenge short-circuit
  (Cloudflare/DataDome/Akamai/PerimeterX → `needs_browser`), `tier_max` clamp, and
  full `timing` + `trace` assembly.
- Intercept **ranking policy** (canonical §11): same-origin +10, api-path +8,
  json +5, analytics −100, static-asset −50.
- **Mutation-safety**: state-changing requests (unsafe methods that aren't
  GraphQL/JSON-RPC reads) are withheld from replay unless `--allow-unsafe-replay`.

### Security sandbox (`draco-jail`)
- Self-re-exec `draco __jail` child: user + network namespace air-gap, Landlock
  filesystem lockdown, two-phase seccomp-bpf (default `KILL`), fd-3 length-prefixed
  IPC codec. V8 runs `--jitless --single-threaded` (no executable memory).

### CLI (`draco-cli`)
- `draco extract <URL>` → `ExtractionResult` JSON (`status`, `source_tier`,
  `data`, `timing`, `trace`). Flags: `--extract <JSONPATH>`, `--tier-max`,
  `--proxy`, `--delay`, `--timeout`, `--capture-window-ms`, `--ignore-robots`,
  `--no-jail`, `--allow-unsafe-replay`, `--pretty`. Exit codes 0/1/2/3.

### Build & packaging
- **Feature-gated Tier 2**: `--no-default-features` yields a lean Tier 0/1 build
  with no V8 or jail linked. Targets `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (full jail) and
  `aarch64-apple-darwin` (dev, un-jailed Tier 2).

### Known limitations
- **Jailed enforcement is validated on bare metal only.** seccomp kills, the
  V8-under-seccomp allowlist, netns, and Landlock require kernel ≥ 5.13 +
  unprivileged user namespaces — see `docs/BARE_METAL_VALIDATION.md`. The
  allowlist is expected to need per-host iteration.
- **JS challenge walls are not defeated** (Cloudflare/DataDome/…) — they return
  `needs_browser`.
- **Framework hydration** is proven for virtual-DOM frameworks (Vue verified);
  frameworks needing layout measurement, real event dispatch, or ES-module/WASM
  delivery may not hydrate in the hand-written polyfill.
- **V8 snapshot** cold-start optimization is intentionally deferred (runtime
  polyfill execution is used instead).
- **musl fully-static** single-binary build is deferred.
