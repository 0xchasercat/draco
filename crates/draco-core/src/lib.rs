//! # draco-core — escalation state machine (WS-C: Tiers 0/1)
//!
//! The orchestrator. [`extract`] runs a single URL through the tiered ladder of
//! spec §11 — `Fetch → Tier0 → Tier1 → Tier2 → Finalize` — stopping at the
//! cheapest tier that yields data:
//!
//! - **Fetch** — one Tier 0 GET (via the [`PageFetcher`] seam), then a
//!   [challenge short-circuit](challenge): a recognized bot-wall finalizes
//!   [`Status::NeedsBrowser`] without spending further compute.
//! - **Tier 0** — static embedded state (`__NEXT_DATA__`, JSON-LD, `__NUXT__`)
//!   via `draco-static`.
//! - **Tier 1** — Next.js build-id `_next/data` replay.
//! - **Tier 2** — runtime interception + [ranked](ranking) replay. The ranking
//!   policy and replay seam ship now; the isolate wiring lands in **Slice 4**
//!   (a marked hook in [`machine`]).
//! - **Finalize** — assemble the [`Timing`] breakdown and the
//!   [`TraceStep`](draco_types::TraceStep) list into an [`ExtractionResult`].
//!
//! ## Effect seams (offline testability)
//!
//! The machine touches the network only through [`PageFetcher`] and the static
//! extractors only through [`StaticEngine`](machine::StaticEngine). In WS-C
//! both `draco-net` and `draco-static` are still `todo!()` stubs, so the whole
//! ladder is unit-tested against mock implementations of these two traits —
//! the crate's own tests never call the stubs.
//!
//! [`extract`] returns a well-formed [`ExtractionResult`] for every input, so
//! the CLI runs end-to-end even though live Tier 0/1 needs the sibling crates.
